Sorry to hear that!

First make sure you have the latest version of AdBlock installed.

Try these things. (reboot, reinstall, delete localstorage)

If you're using Safari, don't forget to turn on autoupdate.

If you only see a white page with some black dots when opening the !AdBlock options page in Safari on a Mac you should delete the !LocalStorage file(s) of !AdBlock. To do this:

 # Quit Safari
 # Open a Finder window by clicking on the Finder
 # Go to: Username -> Library -> Safari -> !LocalStorage
 # Search for the "safari-extension_com.betafish.adblocksafari-letters&numbers.localstorage" file(s)
 # Delete this file(s)

Now you can open Safari again and go to the !AdBlock options.

We can't block video ads except on Youtube, due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari. This isn't perfect either. If it doesn't work on Youtube, try reloading the page.

If you subscribe to a ton of filter lists, it might run slowly.
