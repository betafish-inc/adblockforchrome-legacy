=Having trouble with !AdBlock? =

Sorry to hear that!  You've come to the right place.

== First thing: ==

Make sure you have !AdBlock installed and have the latest version. [http://chromeadblock.com/help/outofdate/ Instructions]

== Next: is this your problem? ==

 * Are you seeing *broken image popups or slideshows* in Safari?
   * This is a [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45586 Safari bug] that will be fixed in an upcoming version of Safari.

 * Are you seeing *ads in videos or Flash games* in Safari?
   * This is a known limitation in Safari.  Only Youtube videos get their ads blocked, and then only some of the time.  You can install [http://www.google.com/chrome/ Chrome on your Mac] and then [http://chromeadblock.com/ AdBlock For Chrome] to get ad blocking in videos/Flash.

 * Is !AdBlock not installing on the *!RockMelt* or *!CoolNovo* browser?
   * !RockMelt is getting an update to work with !AdBlock's latest version. Star issue 6874 to get notified as this gets fixed. It also contains an old version of !AdBlock you can install.
   * !CoolNovo users, install the !AdBlock version in Issue 6920.

 * Are you seeing some other *ad that should be blocked*?
   * To report the ad, please [FrequentlyAskedQuestions#How_do_I_report_an_ad? use the reporting wizard].  Opera users, for now please report it [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Ad%20report%20from%20user&comment=1.%20Exactly%20where%20on%20that%20page%20is%20the%20ad%3F%20What%20does%20it%20look%20like%3F%20Attach%20a%20screenshot%20with%20the%20ad%20clearly%20marked%2C%20if%20you%20can.%0A%0A%0A2.%20Paste%20a%20working%20filter%2C%20if%20you%20have%20one%3A%0A%0A%0A3.%20Any%20other%20information%20that%20would%20be%20helpful%2C%20besides%20what%20is%20listed%0Abelow%3A%0A%0A%0A4.%20In%20what%20language%20is%20the%20page%20written%3F%0A%0A%0A5.%20The%20exact%20URL%20to%20the%20page%20with%20the%20ad.%20(This%20is%20the%20exact%20text%20you'll%20see%20in%20the%20address%20bar)%0A%0A%0A6.%20Which%20filter%20lists%20are%20you%20subscribed%20to%3F%20(Default%20isn't%20an%20answer%20here%3B%20the%20defaults%20depend%20on%20your%20location)%0A%0A%0A%0A7.%20Which%20version%20of%20Opera%20are%20you%20using%3F%20(Latest%20isn't%20an%20answer%2C%20if%20I%20see%20this%20issue%20next%20year%2C%20it%20certainly%20isn't%20the%20latest%20version%20anymore)%0A%0A%0A%0A8.%20What%20version%20of%20AdBlock%20are%20you%20using%3F%0A%0A%0A%0A9.%20What%20settings%20are%20enabled%20in%20the%20first%20tab%20of%20the%20options%20page%3F%0A%0A%0A%0A10.%20What%20custom%20filters%20are%20you%20using%3F%20This%20is%20the%20content%20of%20the%20big%20text%20box%20on%20the%20third%20tab%20of%20the%20options%20page.%0A here].
