=Having trouble with !AdBlock? =

Sorry to hear that!  You've come to the right place.
<br/>

== Is this your problem? ==

 * Did !AdBlock *stop working in Chrome*?
   !AdBlock was probably disabled by a recent bug in Chrome.  The surefire way to get the fix is to uninstall (go to chrome://extensions -> !AdBlock -> Remove) and reinstall (go to http://chromeadblock.com/ and click Add To Chrome.)

 * Did !AdBlock *stop working in Safari*?
   This is fixed in !AdBlock 2.4.33.  [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/HowToFixIt#2._Make_sure_you_have_the_latest_version_of_AdBlock_for_Safari_i Get the latest version] and !AdBlock should no longer randomly stop working.  If you tried this and that's not your problem, see below.

 * Are you seeing *infinite error message* when you start Safari?
   This is fixed in !AdBlock 2.4.33.  After force quitting Safari, you can uninstall !AdBlock via Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> !AdBlock -> Uninstall, then reinstall from safariadblock.com to fix the problem. 

 * Are you *seeing !AdBlock's install screen* every time you start your browser?
   In Safari, this is fixed in !AdBlock 2.4.33; [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/HowToFixIt#2._Make_sure_you_have_the_latest_version_of_AdBlock_for_Safari_i get the latest version] for the fix.  In Chrome, follow step 5 in the "5 easy steps" below.

 * Are you seeing *broken image popups or slideshows* in Safari?
   This is a [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45586 Safari bug] that will be fixed in an upcoming version of Safari.

 * Did Chrome just disable !AdBlock and ask you to *confirm new permissions*?
   * See [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Why_did_Chrome_disable_AdBlock_and_make_me_accept_crazy_new_perm detailed explanation].  It's safe to confirm these permissions.

 * Are you seeing *ads in videos or Flash games* in Safari?
   This is a known limitation in Safari.  Only Youtube videos get their ads blocked, and then only some of the time.  You can install [http://www.google.com/chrome/ Chrome on your Mac] and then [http://chromeadblock.com/ AdBlock For Chrome] to get ad blocking in videos/Flash.

 * Are you seeing some other *ad that should be blocked*?

   To report the ad, please do the following:

   # Turn on Advanced mode under the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options -> General
   # In Chrome: click the toolbar button -> Report an ad
   # In Safari: click the toolbar button -> Customize -> Report an ad

   You'll get the fix automatically a few days after your report is processed.
