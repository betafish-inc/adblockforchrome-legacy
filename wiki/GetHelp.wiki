Sorry to hear that!

Make sure you have the latest version of AdBlock installed. Not sure what version you have?



If that doesn't work, please try these things:
  # Reboot your computer
  # Uninstall AdBlock and then reinstall from ChromeAdBlock.com or SafariAdBlock.com depending which browser you're using.
  # Delete your localstorage. In Windows this can be found ... In Mac OS X, this can be found  ... here.

_Safari Users_: Don't forget to turn on autoupdate.

  * We can't block video ads except on Youtube, due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari. This isn't perfect either. If it doesn't work on Youtube, try reloading the page.

  * If you subscribe to a ton of filter lists, it might run slowly. Please only subscribe to filters you *need*.
