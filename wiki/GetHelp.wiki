== Known issues ==

  * *!AdBlock stops working in Safari 5.1* after you use Private Browsing.  Disabling and re-enabling extensions via Safari | Preferences | Extensions will fix this (and all your other extensions which stopped working too!)  Please [http://bugreport.apple.com report this to Apple] to help us get it fixed sooner.

  * *The install screen appears every time you start your browser* if:
    * _you have told Safari 5.1 to delete your cookies after every restart_.  Apple is working to fix this; in the meantime, you can work around this by turning off this Safari option.
    * _your browser screws up the "localStorage" file on disk._  You can follow step 5 at the top of the page to fix this.

  * *!AdBlock can't block ads in videos or Flash games* yet due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari.  This feature only works on !YouTube, but it is still in beta -- if something goes wrong on !YouTube, try reloading the page. Star [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60101 this Chrome issue] to get this fixed in Chrome.

  * *The Lazy Background Pages experimental feature* breaks !AdBlock in Chrome. Disable the option to fix this.

  * *Image slideshows and popups are broken* on some websites due to a bug in Google Chrome and Safari. This is caused by an  [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45586 issue in WebKit]. This is fixed in Chrome 16+ and most likely in the Safari version after 5.1.
