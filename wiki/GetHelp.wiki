= Known issues =

  * Preroll ads and other ads in videos and other elements which use flash can't be blocked yet due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari. This feature only works on !YouTube, but it is still in beta so it might not work all the time. If it doesn't work on !YouTube, try reloading the page.

  * !AdBlock might break the image zoom on some pages due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari.

  * If you subscribe to a lot of filter lists, !AdBlock and Chrome/Safari might run slowly. Please only subscribe to filters you *really need*, like the recommended filter lists and the lists of languages the most sites you visit are written in.
