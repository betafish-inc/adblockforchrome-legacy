Sorry to hear that!

=== Here are some easy steps which fix most of the problems: ===
 # Make sure you have the latest version of Chrome/Safari and !AdBlock installed
 # Reboot your computer
 # Uninstall !AdBlock and then reinstall from [http://chromeadblock.com www.chromeadblock.com (Google Chrome)] or [http://safariadblock.com www.safariadblock.com (Safari)]
 # Delete the !LocalStorage. The !LocalStorage file of Chrome can be found [HowToFixIt#5._Delete_the_LocalStorage_file_of_AdBlock_for_Chrome here] and the !LocalStorage file of Safari can be found [HowToFixIt#5._Delete_the_LocalStorage_file_of_AdBlock_for_Safari here].

_*Safari Users*_: Don't forget to turn on the extensions autoupdate as described [HowToFixIt#Enable_autoupdate_for_extensions here].

= Known issues =

  * We can't block video ads except on Youtube, due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari. This isn't perfect either. If it doesn't work on Youtube, try reloading the page.

  * !AdBlock breaks the image zoom on some pages due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari.

  * If you subscribe to a ton of filter lists, it might run slowly. Please only subscribe to filters you *need*.
