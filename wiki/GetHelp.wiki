== Known issues ==

  * *!AdBlock can't block ads in videos or Flash games* yet due to a limitation in Google Chrome and Safari.  This feature only works on !YouTube, but it is still in beta -- if something goes wrong on !YouTube, try reloading the page.

  * *Image slideshows and popups are broken* on some websites due to a bug in Google Chrome and Safari.

  * *You will slow down your browser* if you subscribe to too many filter lists.  !AdBlock subscribes you to the lists that will work well for you.  You don't need to subscribe to more language-specific lists unless you visit lots of websites written in that language.
