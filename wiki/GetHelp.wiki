=Having trouble with !AdBlock? =

Sorry to hear that!  You've come to the right place.
<br/>

== Is this your problem? ==

 * Did !AdBlock *stop working in Safari*?
   This is fixed in !AdBlock 2.4.33.  [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/HowToFixIt#2._Make_sure_you_have_the_latest_version_of_AdBlock_for_Safari_i Get the latest version] and !AdBlock should no longer randomly stop working.  If you tried this and that's not your problem, see below.

 * Are you *seeing !AdBlock's install screen* every time you start your browser?
   In Safari, this is fixed in !AdBlock 2.4.33; [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/HowToFixIt#2._Make_sure_you_have_the_latest_version_of_AdBlock_for_Safari_i get the latest version] for the fix.  In Chrome, follow step 5 in the "5 easy steps" below.

 * Are you seeing *broken image popups or slideshows* on a website?
   This is a [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45586 browser bug] that has been fixed in Chrome 16 and in an upcoming version of Safari.

 * Are you seeing *ads in videos or Flash games*?
   This is a known limitation in the browser.  Only Youtube videos get their ads blocked, and then only some of the time.  Chrome is fixing this shortly; not so, unfortunately, in Safari.

 * Are you seeing some other *ad that should be blocked*?

   To report the ad, please do the following:

   # Turn on Advanced mode under the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options -> General
   # In Chrome: click the toolbar button -> Report an ad
   # In Safari: click the toolbar button -> Customize -> Report an ad

   You'll get the fix automatically a few days after your report is processed.
