Users report ads and bugs all the time in the Issue Tracker.  It would be wonderful if you would help keep up with the load.

 * You could make sure [#Filling_in_missing_information no information is missing] in Issue reports.  We can't fix a problem until we understand it.
 * You could try to [#Reproducing_bugs reproduce a reported bug].  If we can't reproduce a bug, we can't fix it.
 * You could [#Handling_ad_reports investigate a reported ad], so we know how best to get rid of it.

Also, if you are a programmer,

 * You could [#Debugging_issues find the cause of reported bugs].  The debugger doesn't have to be the coder, so by debugging you give the coder a huge head start.
 * You could [#Writing_patches submit a patch] to implement a bugfix or feature.  This is of course a huge help.

Also,

 * You could [#Answering_questions_from_users answer questions from other users] in the help forum.
 * You could create or improve !AdBlock's [HowToTranslate translation into your language].

<h4>Join the project!</h4>

After you've gotten a feel for the project, you should definitely ask to [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor]!  Contributors can additionally do the following:
 * You could [#Triaging_issues_(Contributors) triage incoming Issues], doing whatever is needed to help move them forward.
 * You could [#Unlabeling_MoreInfoNeeded_s_(Contributors) unlabel MoreInfoNeeded issues].  If this doesn't happen, actionable Issues remain mostly hidden.
 * You could [#Judging_PotentiallyCritical_s_(Contributors) review PotentiallyCritical issues] in case anything scary is happening.
 * If you can read code, you could [#Reviewing_code_(Contributors) do a code review] - the author of the code will appreciate it!

All open issues sorted by when they were [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=&sort=opened&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20WaitingOn%20BlockedOn opened] or  [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20WaitingOn%20BlockedOn last modified].

= Details =

=== Filling in missing information ===

Users file new Issue reports when they find a bug or have a feature request.  Sometimes they leave out some of the information that we ask in the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect defect report template] or [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Feature%20request%20from%20user enhancement report template], or are just plain unclear.

We tell users that we will ignore incomplete bug reports, but in practice we usually don't.  Instead, we add comments to the Issue asking followup questions until we have all the info we need.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Filling_in_missing_information detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

If you've done this for a week or so, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor].  Then you'll be able to help with these Issues in more powerful ways which aren't mentioned here.

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement+Status%3ANew+-label%3AMoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID+Opened+Modified+Type+Summary all the Issues that may be missing information].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Reproducing bugs ===

Users file new Issue reports when they find a bug.  The [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect defect report template] asks the user to give a "repro", which is a recipe for letting someone else reproduce the buggy behavior.

You can then follow the recipe and add a comment to the Issue saying whether or not you saw the buggy behavior.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Reproducing_bugs detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

If you've done this for a week or so, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor].  Then you'll be able to help with these Issues in more powerful ways which aren't mentioned here.

=== Handling ad reports ===

Users can use !AdBlock's built-in ad reporting wizard when they see an ad.  The wizard usually tells the user to report the ad elsewhere, to the people who run the "filter lists" containing lists of known ads to block.  But sometimes the wizard thinks the ad is not due to a missing filter, but due to a problem in !AdBlock itself.

In that case, the wizard tells the user to file a new Issue reporting the ad.  We then go figure out exactly how we're going to handle the situation.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Handling_ad_reports detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

If you've done this for a week or so, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor].  Then you'll be able to help with these Issues in more powerful ways which aren't mentioned here.

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=adreport%20Status:New%20-label%3AMoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the ad reports to investigate].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

_If you enjoy handling ad reports, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Type-AdReport` label to be emailed when a new ad report comes in._

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Debugging issues ===

Once a bug has been [#Reproducing_bugs reproduced], we need to know the cause in order to fix it.  The person who finds the cause doesn't have to be the person who fixes the bug.  If you don't feel that you have the time or ability to write code, you can still save someone else time by figuring out where in the code the problem lies -- and I'm sure they would appreciate your effort!  This is also a great way to get to know !AdBlock's code better, to prepare you to submit your own patches.

Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Debugging_issues detailed instructions] for how to get !AdBlock's code onto your machine, use browser debugging tools to find the root cause of a bug report, and update the Issue report with your findings.  (You'll only need to refer to these instructions for a while and then you'll get the hang of it.)

If you plan to debug more than one Issue, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor].  Then you'll be able to help in more powerful ways which aren't mentioned here.

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Defect%20Status:Accepted%20-Cause:Known%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner%20Modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner all the Issues awaiting debugging].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

=== Writing patches ===

Code contributions from volunteers are always welcome.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Writing_patches detailed instructions] for how to create and submit them.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

After a few of your patches have been accepted, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project become an official Contributor] and ask for Commit permission.  This makes writing, submitting, reviewing, and collaborating on code easier.

Here are all the open [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Defect%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Cause+Modified&colspec=Cause%20ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner bug reports] and [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Enhancement%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner feature requests].  Bug reports that have been debugged already are listed first; otherwise, Issues that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

=== Answering questions from users ===

Theoretically, users seeking answers should be directed to the [Support Support page], which has links to the FAQs before they are directed to email the help forum (the adblockforchrome-discuss Google Group) or to email Michael directly.  But some users either don't see those links, or find a link to the help forum somewhere else.

So most of the [http://groups.google.com/group/adblockforchrome-discuss posts to the help forum] can be answered by [FrequentlyAskedQuestions the FAQ].  You could help these users by politely pointing them to a relevent answer, e.g.
<pre>
Thanks for your question.  See
  http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#How_do_I_uninstall_AdBlock_? 
for the answer.
</pre>

If you wanted to politely ask the user whether they had seen the link to the FAQ, that would be helpful as well.  They might say they found a link to the help forum elsewhere, which we can try to replace with a link to [Support Support], or that they skimmed the FAQ but missed the answer, which suggests we might try to simplify the FAQ.

Some useful shortcuts when composing your message: `getadblock.com/support getadblock.com/bugs getadblock.com/faq getadblock.com/faq/uninstall getadblock.com/faq/textenhance getadblock.com/faq/hunting`.  `getadblock.com` itself will direct the user to the appropriate install page for their browser.

*Important:* If you subscribe to the help forum mailing list, adblockforchrome-discuss@googlegroups.com, and you reply over email, *be sure to reply-all*, because replies by default go only to the poster.  This is so posters don't have to join the forum to ask a single question; they can just send an email.  Reply-all will send your reply to the mailing list as well, so others know that the question has been answered.  If the user replies back to you, they may reply directly to you; just cc adblockforchrome-discuss@googlegroups.com when you reply back to them.

=== Triaging issues (Contributors) ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project Contributor] to triage issues._

New Issues are always being filed, and they start out as `Status:New` in the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement%20Status:New%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary triage list].  Triage is the process of *moving them out of that list*, one step closer to being closed.

Without triage, the Issue Tracker gets messy, important Issues go unnoticed for too long, and some Issues get missed entirely.  Triage is therefore one of the most *important and useful things that you can do* as a Contributor.  It takes more knowledge of the project than most other tasks, and is also the most complex task, since you're making a judgment call on how to proceed with the Issue, then doing whatever may be necessary to start the process.

Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Triaging_issues detailed instructions] for how to triage an Issue.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement%20Status:New%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the untriaged Issues].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

_If you enjoy triaging issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Type-Defect` and `Type-Enhancement` labels to be notified when a new report comes in.  You'll get emailed all the updates too, that way, so you'll probably want to filter out the followup emails using email filters._

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Unlabeling `MoreInfoNeeded`s (Contributors) ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project Contributor] to unlabel issues._

We label an Issue `MoreInfoNeeded` when we're waiting on a user to leave a comment with more information.  This removes it from most of the lists of Issues, since we can't really take action on them without that information.

Later, we must remove the label (if there was a reply) or close the Issue (if no reply ever came).  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Unlabeling_MoreInfoNeeded_s detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=label:MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the MoreInfoNeeded Issues].  The *most recently modified* ones are listed first, as they are the ones that probably have been replied to.  The ones listed last are getting old.

_If you enjoy handling `MoreInfoNeeded` issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `MoreInfoNeeded` label to be emailed when replies come in from users._

[#top Back]

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Judging `PotentiallyCritical`s (Contributors) ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project Contributor] to judge these issues._

Users file new Issue reports when they find a bug.  If they think that it is a really serious bug, we let them label it `PotentiallyCritical`.  If the bug meets our definition of "really serious", then we label it `Priority-Critical` and scary alarm emails get sent out so we can ship a fix quickly.  We warn the user ahead of time that if the bug _doesn't_ meet our definition, we might punish the report a little for spamming us, by ignoring it for a while.

You can review these `PotentiallyCritical` issues and judge whether they meet our criteria for sending out scary alarm emails.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Judging_PotentiallyCritical_s detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3APotentiallyCritical&sort=opened&colspec=ID+Opened+Modified+Priority+Reporter+Status+Summary all PotentiallyCritical issues].

_Become a first responder! If you enjoy watching out for `PotentiallyCritical` issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `PotentiallyCritical` label to be emailed when new ones come in._

_If you wouldn't mind helping firefight, you can also [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Priority-Critical` label to be emailed when truly critical bugs do appear._

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Reviewing code (Contributors) ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project Contributor] to review code._

Code that goes into !AdBlock's trunk is almost always reviewed first.  Having at least one other person see your code greatly increases the chance of getting it right.

Any Contributor can review code.  Even if you don't understand that area of !AdBlock, you can comment on style and suggest ways to simplify or clarify the code.  Even if you don't have time to download and test the code, you can still read it in the browser.

Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Reviewing_code detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=status:needsreview&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Owner%20Summary all the Issues awaiting code review].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.
