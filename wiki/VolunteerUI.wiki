#summary Resources for volunteers

[link overview - read this first.] _TODO contains introduction, rules, and how to get started._

= My issues =

You own [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=owner:me&sort=id&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Type%20Summary these] open issues.

_Owning an issue means no one else will work on it, so you shouldn't own more than a few issues at once, and you should usually work on these issues before any others.  ([#When_should_I_de_own_an_issue? When should I de-own an issue?])_

= Ways to help =

*First*: Clean up [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3ACleanUp&colspec=ID+Stars+Type+Status+Priority+Area+Summary&cells=tiles these issues]: make sure Type, Status, and Owner are correct according to [#Definition_of_Owner these definitions (todo)].  _TODO Michael will probably do this in an afternoon and delete this paragraph at that point_

=Instructions=

=== Definiton of Type ===

*Type-EnhancementRequest*: request for !AdBlock to do something it can't currently do.  There's nothing broken, it would just make !AdBlock better in the reporter's opinion.

*Type-Defect*: a bug in !AdBlock.  Something that can be described as a specific set of steps that should lead to an expected behavior but lead to a buggy behavior instead.  (The difference between Defect and EncancementRequest can be fuzzy if the lack of a feature is considered a bug.)

*Type-AdReport*: The end result of the AdBlock ad reporting wizard.  It represents an ad shown, or a non-ad blocked, that doesn't have the same behavior in Adblock Plus.  _TODO Does every legitimate AdReport become a Defect, and the rest become ReportToList?_

=== Definition of Owner ===

Anyone can work anywhere in the code.  Setting yourself to Owner of an Issue just means:

 * You plan to debug or write code against the Issue in the next few days.
 * You might de-own an Issue if you change your mind.
 * Others can still debug or write code against the Issue, but they're probably duplicating your work.  A better idea is for them to offer help in a comment, so you can work together.

=== When should I de-own an Issue? ===

You own issues to tell others that you will address this issue very soon, so that they avoid duplicating your work.  If you don't work on an issue for a week or so, de-own it until you're ready to work on it.

When you de-own an issue, you could leave a comment summarizing what progress you've made, for the benefit of whomever picks up where you left off.
