Would you be interested in making !AdBlock better for millions of users?  I would *really appreciate* any help you want to give!
<br>
Read the [VolunteerInstructions#Project_overview project overview], pick something interesting below, and [http://groups.google.com/group/adblockforchrome-discuss just ask] if you have any questions.  Have fun!

- Michael
<br>
_PS: If you enjoy helping with !AdBlock, I'd love for you to *[VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project join the project]*.  Then you'll be [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/people/list listed] as an official member, and can do more to help!_


== Ways to help ==

Users report ads and bugs all the time in the Issue Tracker.  It would be wonderful if you would help keep up with the load.

 * You could [#Verifying_issues verify an Issue], checking that it is legitimate and that it makes sense.
 * You could [#Investigating_ad_reports investigate a reported ad], so we know how best to get rid of it.

 * If you can read code, you could [#Debugging_issues find the cause of a bug], giving a big head start to whomever writes code to fix the bug.
 * If you can write code, you could [#Writing_patches submit a patch] to implement a bugfix or feature.  This is of course a huge help.

Also,

 * You could [#Answering_questions_from_users answer questions from other users] in the help forum.
 * You could help [HowToTranslate translate] !AdBlock into your language.

<h4>Bonus for [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project members] only:</h4>

 * You could [#Unlabeling_MoreInfoNeeded_s unlabel MoreInfoNeeded issues] when the info arrives.  Otherwise these Issues stay hidden and we don't handle them.
 * You could [#Triaging_issues triage Issues], doing whatever is needed to help move them forward.
 * You could [#Judging_PotentiallyCritical_s review PotentiallyCritical issues] in case anything scary is happening.
 * If you can read code, please [#Reviewing_code do a code review] - the author of the code will appreciate it!

Once you're familiar with the project, you can use the "Task links" above to go straight to the Issues for the tasks you enjoy.<br>
And if you like doing everything, you may prefer to just watch the "`changed-this-week`" list and tackle any recently modified Issues as needed.

=== Michael's favorites ===

Everything you do to help gives me more time to work on improving !AdBlock.  [#Verifying_issues Verifying Issues] and [#Investigating_ad_reports investigating reported ads] are two in particular that I would love for you to handle if you're just getting started.

As a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project member], you would be my *hero* if, on any day that you felt like helping out, you did these tasks in this order:
 # Unlabel any `MoreInfoNeeded`s that have been answered (use the "`unlabel`" Task Links above)
 # Triage everything you see in the triage list ("`triage`")
 # If you can read code, do a code review ("`codereview`")
 # Respond to any unanswered threads in the help forum ("`help-forum`")
 # If you can read code, try to debug any Issue not yet debugged ("`debug`")
 # Investigate any new ad reports ("`adreport`")

= Details =

Each of the sections below is linked to from above; just read the ones that interest you.

=== Investigating ad reports ===

Users can use !AdBlock's built-in ad reporting wizard when they see an ad.  The wizard usually tells the user to report the ad elsewhere, to the people who run the "filter lists" containing lists of known ads to block.  But sometimes the wizard thinks the ad is not due to a missing filter, but due to a problem in !AdBlock itself.

In that case, the wizard tells the user to file a new Issue reporting the ad.  We then go figure out exactly how we're going to handle the situation.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Investigating_ad_reports detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=adreport%20Status:New%20-label%3AMoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the ad reports to investigate].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

_If you enjoy investigating ad reports, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Type-AdReport` label to be emailed when a new ad report comes in._

=== Verifying issues ===

Users file new Issue reports when they find a bug or have a feature request.  As the very first step in handling the Issue, we must make sure we know what they are talking about.

When a new Issue labeled `Type-Defect` (bug report) or `Type-Enhancement` (feature request) arrives in [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement+Status%3ANew+-label%3AMoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID+Opened+Modified+Type+Summary this list], do the following:

 * Add a comment asking for any missing info that we asked for in the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect defect Issue template] or [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Feature%20request%20from%20user enhancement Issue template].  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Filling_in_missing_information detailed instructions] if you want them.

 * Add a comment to `Type-Defect` Issues saying whether you can see the buggy behavior on your end.  If no one can see the behavior, we can't proceed with fixing the bug.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Reproducing_bugs detailed instructions] for reproducing bugs.

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Debugging issues ===

Once a bug has been [#Verifying_issues verified], we need to know the cause in order to fix it.  The person who finds the cause doesn't have to be the person who fixes the bug.  If you don't feel that you have the time or ability to write code, you can still save someone else time by figuring out where in the code the problem lies -- and I'm sure they would appreciate your effort!  This is also a great way to get to know !AdBlock's code better, to prepare you to submit your own patches.

If you're not familiar with extension development, here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Debugging_issues detailed instructions] for how to debug in the browser, and to get !AdBlock's code onto your machine if you need it.

When you're done, [VolunteerInstructions#When_you're_finished_debugging here's how] you should update the Issue with your findings.

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Defect%20Status:Accepted%20-Cause:Known%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner%20Modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner all the Issues awaiting debugging].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

=== Writing patches ===

Code contributions are always welcome!  In short, you find an interesting [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Enhancement%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner feature] or [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Defect%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Cause+Modified&colspec=Cause%20ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner bug] report, get !AdBlock's [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/source/checkout code], make your changes according to the [VolunteerInstructions#Coding_style style guide], then add a patchfile to the report.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Writing_patches detailed instructions] if you need them.

After a few of your patches have been accepted, you should [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project join the project] and ask for Commit permission.  This makes writing, submitting, reviewing, and collaborating on code easier.

Here are all the open [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Defect%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Cause+Modified&colspec=Cause%20ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner bug reports] and [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type=Enhancement%20Status:Accepted%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-Owner+Modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Status%20Summary%20Owner feature requests].  Bug reports that have been debugged already are listed first; otherwise, Issues that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

=== Answering questions from users ===

The Support page at [Support getadblock.com/support] lets users email !AdBlock's help forum with questions.  It would be great if you would help respond, so users are answered quickly!

To sign up, go to the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adblockforchrome-discuss help forum] and click "Join Group".  Tell it to send you email for each message that arrives.

When you reply to an email, be sure to *reply-all*, because by default, replies only go to the author, not the group.  If the author replies directly back to you, for posterity cc adblockforchrome-discuss@googlegroups.com again when you reply back.

In addition to directing users to the help forum, [Support getadblock.com/support] tells users to either read the [FrequentlyAskedQuestions general FAQ] or [PaymentsFAQ payments FAQ]; to go to [http://getadblock.com/bugs getadblock.com/bugs] to solve simple problems or file a new Issue report; or to email Michael @getadblock.com directly.  Read those pages so you know when to point users to one of those resources.  And over time you'll learn how to answer more questions.

There's only one rule: *be polite* :)

Some useful links when composing your message:
<pre>
  getadblock.com/support
  getadblock.com/bugs
  getadblock.com/faq
  getadblock.com/faq/uninstall
  getadblock.com/faq/textenhance
  getadblock.com/faq/hunting`</pre>
And `getadblock.com` itself opens the install page for the user's browser.

=== Triaging issues ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project member] to triage issues._

New Issues are always being filed, and they start out as `Status:New` in the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement%20Status:New%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary triage list].  Triage is the process of *moving them out of that list*, one step closer to being closed.

Without triage, the Issue Tracker gets messy, important Issues go unnoticed for too long, and some Issues get missed entirely.  Triage is therefore one of the most *important and useful things that you can do to help*.  It takes more knowledge of the project than most other tasks, and is also the most complex task, since you're making a judgment call on how to proceed with the Issue, then doing whatever may be necessary to start the process.

Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Triaging_issues detailed instructions] for how to triage an Issue.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type=defect,enhancement%20Status:New%20-MoreInfoNeeded&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the untriaged Issues].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.

_If you enjoy triaging issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Type-Defect` and `Type-Enhancement` labels to be notified when a new report comes in.  You'll get emailed all the updates too, that way, so you'll probably want to filter out the followup emails using email filters._

[#top Home]

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Unlabeling `MoreInfoNeeded`s ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project member] to unlabel issues._

We label an Issue `MoreInfoNeeded` when we're waiting on a user to leave a comment with more information.  This removes it from most of the lists of Issues, since we can't really take action on them without that information.

Later, we must remove the label (if there was a reply) or close the Issue (if no reply ever came).  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Unlabeling_MoreInfoNeeded_s detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=label:MoreInfoNeeded&sort=-modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Type%20Summary all the MoreInfoNeeded Issues].  The *most* recently modified ones are listed first, as they are the ones that probably have been replied to.  The ones listed last are getting old.

_If you enjoy handling `MoreInfoNeeded` issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `MoreInfoNeeded` label to be emailed when replies come in from users._

[#top Home]

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Judging `PotentiallyCritical`s ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project member] to judge these issues._

Users file new Issue reports when they find a bug.  If they think that it is a really serious bug, we let them label it `PotentiallyCritical`.  If the bug meets our definition of "really serious", then _we_ label it `Priority-Critical` and scary alarm emails get sent out so we can ship a fix quickly.  We warn the user ahead of time that if the bug _doesn't_ meet our definition, we might punish the report a little for spamming us, by ignoring it for a while.

You can review these `PotentiallyCritical` issues and judge whether they meet our criteria for sending out scary alarm emails.  Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Judging_PotentiallyCritical_s detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3APotentiallyCritical&sort=opened&colspec=ID+Opened+Modified+Priority+Reporter+Status+Summary all PotentiallyCritical issues].

_Become a first responder! If you enjoy watching out for `PotentiallyCritical` issues, you can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `PotentiallyCritical` label to be emailed when new ones come in._

_If you wouldn't mind helping firefight, you can also [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/subscriptions subscribe to] the `Priority-Critical` label to be emailed when truly critical bugs do appear._

[#top Home]

<br><br><hr><hr>

=== Reviewing code ===

_You must be a [VolunteerInstructions#Joining_the_project project member] to review code._

Code that goes into !AdBlock's trunk is almost always reviewed first.  Having at least one other person see your code greatly increases the chance of getting it right.

Anyone may review code.  Even if you don't understand that area of !AdBlock, you can comment on style and suggest ways to simplify or clarify the code.  Even if you don't have time to download and test the code, you can still read it in the browser.

Here are [VolunteerInstructions#Detailed_instructions_for:_Reviewing_code detailed instructions] for how to do that.  (You'll only need to refer to them a couple of times before you get the hang of it.)

Here are [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=status:needsreview&sort=modified&colspec=ID%20Opened%20Modified%20Owner%20Summary all the Issues awaiting code review].  The ones that have been waiting longest for attention are listed first.
