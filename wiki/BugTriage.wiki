What kind of issue are you reporting?

== I see an ad! ==

Please don't report ads directly here.  Instead, turn on !AdBlock Options -> Advanced mode, then report them via the "Report an ad" link in the toolbar menu (Chrome) or Options -> Customize tab (Safari).

That way, we get all the information we need, and we know that it's not just a missing filter in a filter list or something.

== !AdBlock is breaking one specific website ==

Here's a list of some really highly trafficked websites:
  * Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Windows Live Mail
  * Google+, Facebook, Twitter
  * Any other Google website (Google search, news, calendar...)
  * A large news website (Yahoo, CNN, BBC, New York Times...)

Is the broken website in this list?
[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Broke%20the%20web Yes!]
[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Broken%20site No, it's another site]

== !AdBlock is breaking many websites ==

Help us decide if this is an emergency or not.

It's an emergency if:
  * The bug affects many websites AND
  * The bug is seriously getting in the way of your browsing AND
  * You suspect other people might be having this bug too.

[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect2 Yes, it's an emergency!]

It's not an emergency (but we'll still take care of you!) if:
  * The bug only appears after you specifically interact with !AdBlock's toolbar button or right click menu OR
  * The bug affects only one non-gigantic website OR
  * You don't feel like it's an emergency.
