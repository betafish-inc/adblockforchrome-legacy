What kind of issue are you reporting?

== I see an ad! ==

Please don't report ads directly here.  Instead, turn on !AdBlock Options -> Advanced mode, then report them via the "Report an ad" link in the toolbar menu (Chrome) or Options -> Customize tab (Safari).

That way, we get all the information we need, and we know that it's not just a missing filter in a filter list or something.

== !AdBlock is breaking one specific website ==

Here's a list of some really highly trafficked websites:
  * Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Windows Live Mail
  * Google+, Facebook, Twitter
  * Any other Google website (Google search, news, calendar...)
  * A large news website (Yahoo, CNN, BBC, New York Times...)

Is the broken website in this list?
[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect2 Yes!]
[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect1 No, it's another site]

== !AdBlock is breaking many websites ==

Help us decide if this is an emergency or not.

It's an emergency if:
  * The bug affects multiple websites
  * AND the bug is seriously getting in the way of your browsing
  * AND you suspect other people might be having this bug too
  * AND it feels to you like an emergency.

[http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Defect2 Yes, it's an emergency!]

It's not an emergency (but we'll still take care of you!) if:
  * You have to click !AdBlock's toolbar button to see the bug
  * OR you have to use !AdBlock's right click menu to see the bug
  * OR it doesn't seem like an emergency to you.
