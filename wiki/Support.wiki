= !AdBlock Support =

Support is equally available to all users, whether or not you pay for !AdBlock.

But there are a lot of users, so support is divided up a bit :)

== Payment-related support (payments, refunds, subscriptions, receipts, etc): ==

I (Michael Gundlach, the creator of !AdBlock) receive all proceeds from your payments -- thanks!  So if [PaymentsFAQ the Payments FAQ] doesn't answer your question, you can email me at [mailto:payments@getadblock.com payments@getadblock.com] for payment-related support.

== General questions: ==

There are also many volunteers helping me by answering general user questions or improving the !AdBlock program.  (I would love [HowToContribute your help] too!)  If your question isn't answered in [FrequentlyAskedQuestions the general FAQ], you can email !AdBlock's  [mailto:adblockforchrome-discuss@googlegroups.com public mailing list] to get help from a volunteer, me, or another !AdBlock user.

== Private questions: ==

If you have a question that shouldn't be read by volunteers/the general public, you can email [mailto:support@getadblock.com support@getadblock.com].

== Problems with !AdBlock: ==

If !AdBlock has a bug, or you see an ad, or you've found some other problem, you can get help [https://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/GetHelp?tm=3 here].

I think that covers everything!  If I've left something out, just drop a suggestion to the mailing list above.
