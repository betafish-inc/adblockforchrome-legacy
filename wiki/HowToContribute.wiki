Would you be interested in making !AdBlock better for our hundreds of thousands of users?  We would love any help you can give!  As you can see below, you don't need to know how to program to help out.

= Ways to contribute =

== Answer FAQs in the feedback comments ==

On the installation page at chromeadblock.com users leave comments and questions, and there aren't that many different questions they ask.  They also consistently fail to see the links to the FAQ and to this project page.  Read FrequentlyAskedQuestions, then drop comments answering questions while gently directing users to the FAQ link.

== Verify a bug! ==

  1 Find an [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type-Defect&colspec=ID+Stars+Type+Status+Priority+Area+Summary&x=area&y=priority&cells=tiles open bug] that doesn't have a comment saying that someone else has reproduced the bug.
  1 Follow the steps to reproduce it, exactly as reported in the Issue.
  1 Leave a comment telling whether it happens for you or not.  The more info about your system you can provide, the better.

== File a bug or feature request! ==

via the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry New Issue] link on the Issues tab.  It helps us a lot if you provide all the info we ask for.

== File an ad report! ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-K on the page in question, do your best to block the ad, then click the "report this ad" link on the final page of the wizard.

== Fix a bug or a add a new feature! ==

!AdBlock is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and there are almost always open Issues that only require CSS or HTML changes, even if you don't know Javascript.  Here's how to help:

  1 Find an Issue that interests you on the Issues tab
  1 Check out the trunk version of the code via the instructions on the Source tab
  1 Make your code changes
  1 Type "svn diff > mycontribution.patch" to create a patchfile
  1 Attach the patchfile to the Issue.

== Tell your friends! ==

Tweet links to http://chromeadblock.com and http://safariadblock.com, email people, rent a megaphone and go to the student union, that kind of thing.  I would expect that millions of users are still using Firefox solely because they don't know !AdBlock exists for Chrome and Safari.  Also, if you know friends who are web programmers, tell them we'd love code contributions! :)

== Become a regular contributor! ==

As of April 2010 !AdBlock has had three people besides the author pour their love into the project via all of the methods above (and I'm eternally grateful!)  If you'd like to contribute bug fixes or fix ad reports regularly, here's a path that seems to work:

  1 If you'd like, create ad reports that include correct filters to fix the problem.  We'll apply the filters for you.
  1 If you'd like, create patches to address open Issues.  We'll apply the patches for you.
  1 Drop a line in the [http://groups.google.com/group/adblockforchrome-dev adblockforchrome-dev] Google Group asking to become an official contributor so you can apply your filters and patches directly.  If you've regularly contributed up to this point and your contributions are high-quality, we'll be more than happy to have you join the group.
