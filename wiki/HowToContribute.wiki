Would you be interested in making !AdBlock better for our millions of users?  We would love any help you can give!  As you can see below, you don't need to know how to program to help out.

= Ways to contribute =

== Triage the Issue tracker ==

This would help a LOT!  Several new Issues arrive every day, and the more people willing to triage them, the less chance of an Issue going unnoticed.

Bookmark the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/updates/list list of Issue updates] and watch for new or updated Issues.  Then do any of these helpful things:

 * Leave a comment saying whether you can reproduce the problem.  Add a screenshot of the problem if there isn't one.

 * Leave a comment asking the submitter to provide any clarifying info they didn't provide.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list Search for duplicates] and leave a comment on the newer bug pointing out that it's a duplicate.

 * Lots of problems are caused by a bad filter.  Use the [http://chromeadblock.com/bugs/hunting filter hunting approach] to find which specific filter is causing the reporter problems, and leave a comment with what you find.

If you think you'll do this more than once or twice, feel free to ask on adblockforchrome-dev@googlegroups.com and I'll happily give you Contributor access, so you can close/merge/prioritize bugs directly.

== Improve the existing translations ==

!AdBlock is translated into dozens of languages, but sometimes the translations are out of date, resulting in missing or incorrect phrases.  If you'd like to help correct problems you've noticed in your language, see HowToTranslate.

== Fix a bug ==

!AdBlock is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS -- see [http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html the Chrome extension tutorial] for details.  If you see an Issue that you'd like to fix,

  1 Check out the trunk version of the code via the instructions on the Source tab and make your changes
  1 Type "svn diff > mycontribution.patch" to create a patchfile
  1 Attach the patchfile to the Issue.

After you do this once, feel free to ask for commit bits on adblockforchrome-dev@googlegroups.com.

== Tell your friends! ==

Spreading the word via social networks / mailing lists / megaphones is always appreciated!

== Committers ==

Here's more info for you once you have commit bits:

=== Mailing lists ===

Subscribe to the adblockforchrome-dev Google Group, which is where we do all our discussion that isn't in Issues or code reviews.  Also subscribe to the adblockforchrome-discuss Google Group to help answer FAQs from users.

=== Committing code ===

Instead of fixing issues in a patch file, you should make `branches/issue-NNNN` for the issue and make your changes there.  When you're done and you've tested them thoroughly, mark the Issue as `Status:NeedsReview`.  I'll review your code for bugs/style, then I'll merge your branch to trunk and set `Status:Fixed`.

==== Coding style ====

Please comment every function you write with a description of what it does, a list of inputs, and what it returns.  See `background.html` for some examples.  Variables should be clearly named instead of short.  When in doubt about whether a chunk of code makes sense, lead it with a comment explaining what's going on.  When in doubt about capitalization, follow the rules of the code around you.  It's mostly `ClassName.functionName with_underscored_vars`.

The code isn't 100% (or even 80%, probably) adherent to the rules in the previous paragraph.  Refactoring is great -- whenever you touch some code, feel free to clean it up.

=== Ad reports ===

In addition to triaging bugs, you can triage ad reports.  They come in via a reporting wizard that makes sure they shouldn't have reported the ad to a filter list maintainer instead.  Verify the ad, find the filter that fixes it (you can test it via the Customize tab), put it directly into `trunk/filters/adblock_custom.txt`, and set `Status:Fixed`.  If you put in a bad filter you can break all of !AdBlock (e.g., no images load on the entire web), so be extra-sure that you get this right!

=== Getting help ===

The best thing you can do to help me is probably to handle a bug or ad report entirely without me knowing about it until it's `ReadyToRelease` or `Fixed` :)  But if you get stuck, or have a question, you can cc adblockforchrome on the Issue and I'll get emailed about it.

If there's a critical issue that needs my immediate attention, set it to Priority:Critical.  I'll get an email automatically at my personal address.  Feel free also to set Priority:High on any issue that you think should be on the shortlist to complete (or just set yourself as owner and start coding!)
