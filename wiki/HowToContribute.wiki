Would you be interested in making !AdBlock better for our 2 million users?  We would love any help you can give!  As you can see below, you don't need to know how to program to help out.

= Ways to contribute =

== Answer FAQs in the feedback comments ==

On the installation page at chromeadblock.com users leave comments and questions, and there aren't that many different questions they ask.  They also consistently fail to see the links to the FAQ and to this project page.  Read FrequentlyAskedQuestions, then drop comments answering questions while gently directing users to the FAQ link.

== Verify a bug! ==

  1 Find an [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=Type-Defect&colspec=ID+Stars+Type+Status+Priority+Area+Summary&x=area&y=priority&cells=tiles open bug] that looks interesting to you.
  1 Follow the steps to reproduce it, exactly as reported in the Issue.
  1 Leave a comment telling whether it happens for you or not.  The more info about your system you can provide, the better.

== File a bug or feature request! ==

via the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry New Issue] link on the Issues tab.  It helps us a lot if you provide all the info we ask for.

== File an ad report! ==

Only via the link at the bottom of AdBlock Options -> Customize, please, as it helps you report all the right information.

== Fix a bug or a add a new feature! ==

!AdBlock is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and there are almost always open Issues that only require CSS or HTML changes, even if you don't know Javascript.  Here's how to help:

  1 Find an Issue that interests you on the Issues tab
  1 Check out the trunk version of the code via the instructions on the Source tab
  1 Make your code changes
  1 Type "svn diff > mycontribution.patch" to create a patchfile
  1 Attach the patchfile to the Issue.

After you do this once, if you'd like to become an official contributor, we'll give you commit bits to the repo.

== Translate !AdBlock into your own language ==

If you want to translate !AdBlock into your own language read this [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/HowToTranslate HowToTranslate Wiki].

== Tell your friends! ==

Tweet links to http://chromeadblock.com and http://safariadblock.com, email people, rent a megaphone and go to the student union, that kind of thing.  I would expect that millions of users are still using Firefox solely because they don't know !AdBlock exists for Chrome and Safari.  Also, if you know friends who are web programmers, tell them we'd love code contributions! :)
