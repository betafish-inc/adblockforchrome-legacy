#summary How to translate AdBlock into your own language

!AdBlock supports translation into many languages.  But there is only one problem: we don't speak all languages ourselves. Therefore we need your help!

Here's how to translate !AdBlock into your own language:

= Is your language supported? =

  # Find your language's "language code."  [http://aruljohn.com/lang.php This website] detects the ones your browser is using.
  # Make sure your language is in Chrome's [http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/i18n.html#locales-supported list of supported language codes].

Anything supported by Chrome will be supported by Safari as well.

= Is it already translated? =

Check the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3Dl10n&colspec=ID+Status+Summary list of existing translations] for a your language.  If it exists, you can leave a comment on there saying you'd like to help, and the original translator or we will talk to you.

= OK so let's translate! =

First, [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/entry?template=Offer%20to%20translate add your language] to the list of translations (so that two people don't start the same translation at the same time).

Then download the [http://adblockforchrome.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_locales/en/messages.json English messages.json file].

If you open that file (you can open it in any text editor, like Notepad), you'll see a lot of entries that look like this one:
{{{
  "updatefromoldversion": {
    "message": "You are using an old version of AdBlock. Please first $updatelink$ the newest version of AdBlock",
    "description": "Instruction telling the user to click a link to update AdBlock",
    "placeholders": {
      "updatelink": {
        "content": "$1download$2",
        "example": "<a href='http://chrome.com/update_here.ctx'>download</a>"
      }
    }
  },
}}}

Every string on *a line that starts with "message" or "content"* needs to be replaced with a translation.

However, there are a few exceptions:
 * {{{AdBlock}}} should not be translated. It is a name and not a word.
 * Words wrapped between {{{$}}} should not be translated -- they refer to placeholders, such as {{{$updatelink$}}} referring to the {{{"updatelink"}}} placeholder above.
 * Make sure to leave $1, $2, etc in your translation -- they are placeholders for strings that AdBlock will insert, such as "<a href='...'>" and "</a>" above.

The above example might look like this after you translated it:
{{{
  "updatefromoldversion": {
    "message": "Ya $updatelink$ iss var gut so yoo do eet to AdBlock noww",
    "description": "Instruction telling the user to click a link to update AdBlock",
    "placeholders": {
      "updatelink": {
        "content": "$1get der file all quicklike$2",
        "example": "<a href='http://chrome.com/update_here.ctx'>download</a>"
      }
    }
  },
}}}

Note some things about my (pretend) translation:
  * I didn't translate "description" or "example" (those are to help the translator)
  * I didn't translate "updatelink" (that is a placeholder)
  * I translated one word in "content" into five, but made sure to keep the $1 and $2
  * I moved $updatelink$ earlier in "message" because it sounded better there in my language

If a "message" or "content" string contains {{{<b>}}}, {{{<i>}}}, {{{<a>}}}, or {{{<br/>}}}, your translation should as well:
 * You can make text *bold* by wrapping it in {{{<b>}}} and {{{</b>}}} like {{{<b>Hi!</b>}}}
 * You can make a text _italic_ by wrapping it in {{{<i>}}} and {{{</i>}}} like {{{<i>Hi!</i>}}}
 * You can make a text a [# hyperlink or a button] by wrapping it in {{{<a>}}} and {{{</a>}}} like {{{<a>click me</a>}}}
 * You can add newlines by adding {{{<br/>}}} like {{{First line<br/>Second line}}}

Common pitfalls
 * *Never* use {{{"}}} in a string, or it will break. Use {{{\"}}} which gets turned into {{{"}}} for you, or just use {{{'}}} instead.
 * Save your file as *UTF-8* to prevent issues with special characters (like Korean characters or characters with accents, like {{{ç}}} or {{{ë}}})

= Finished? =

When you finish, just attach your file to the [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3Dl10n&colspec=ID+Status+Summary note you left above].  We'll take care of the rest!

= Maintaining =

When we change strings in !AdBlock, we'll add them to a list here, so you know to change them in your file.

|| *We changed this message* || *on this date* ||
|| (none yet!) || (none yet!) ||

And most importantly...
