#summary Design of a new way for volunteers to easily find things that need doing, and to do them.

Currently, when someone decides they'd like to volunteer with AdBlock, they are pointed to HowToContribute.  That document is a big mix of instructions that, to someone who knows nothing about the project structure, can seem daunting and vague.  I (Michael) get the impression that people don't know where to start, and end up not starting at all.

I'd like to replace that with a workflow that breaks tasks into simple, discrete chunks, and provides volunteers with a menu of tasks to complete, each with simple instructions.  That would help casual volunteers who may want to help once, or once a month, so that they can offer their contribution without having to learn everything about the project.  It would also help long-time contributors to the project (myself included), by providing a dashboard of what work is falling through the cracks.
