== !AdBlock isn't working right! ==

Sorry to hear that!  We can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/GetHelp?tm=3 walk you through] fixing or reporting your problem.

== How do I blacklist something? ==

Right-click on a page once it has finished loading, select "Block an ad on this page..." and you'll get a blacklisting UI or simply right-click an ad on a page and select "Block this ad".  You can also add the browser action button via the Options page, and blacklist from there.

== How do I undo if I blacklisted something accidentally? ==

The blacklist UI creates entries in the customized filters tab on the Options page. You can add, replace, or remove filters there if you are feeling advanced.

== How do I stop !AdBlock from running on a page? ==

Right-click (or use the browser action button) on a page, select "Don't run on this domain..." and you'll have the option to exclude that domain.  The Options page gives you a list of all excluded domains.

== Does this actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

Yes, but some ads still slip through as this feature isn't fully supported by Chrome yet. Please star [http://crbug.com/35897 Chromium issue 35897] if you want Chrome to implement this.
Also we are not yet able to block ads that appear in other plugins, like Flash.

== Are you the same guys that made Adblock Plus for Firefox? ==

No, the main developer for ABP is Wladimir Palant and he lives in Germany.  The main dev for !AdBlock is Michael Gundlach and he lives in Georgia in the US.  Both extensions use the !EasyList filter list (as well as several others) and those are maintained by independent users.


== Can I import my filters from Adblock Plus for Firefox? ==

Yes, you can. Select the rules in ABP in FF, press Ctrl-C, go to !AdBlock options, Customize tab, click Edit, and paste them in that text box.

== Can I synchronize my settings and filters among multiple computers? ==

Not automatically.  You can manually set your settings the same, of course, and copy-and-paste your custom filters (from the !AdBlock Options Customize tab) between computers.

== Do you recommend to subscribe to all filter lists? ==

No, not at all.  !AdBlock subscribes you to the lists you should need.  The more filter lists you use, the slower AdBlock runs, and the more chance of false positives.  Lists for languages you don't speak will be useless to you.  And it wastes bandwidth for the filter list maintainers.

== Do you maintain all filter lists yourselves? ==

No, we only maintain the !AdBlock custom filters. All other lists are maintained by volunteers that are not connected to !AdBlock. (Except for the Dutch list, which is maintained by !FamLam). To contact a list maintainer you can use the links or email addresses in ListAuthorContacts for the default lists. For custom lists you often have to look in the list itself to see if there is a contact address.

== When I install, Chrome warns me that !AdBlock will have access to all my private data and browsing history! ==

It's true.  !AdBlock has the *ability* to access to your private data, but it doesn't actually access it.  In order to remove ads from every web page, !AdBlock needs the permission to run on every web page; and any extension that runs on every web page has the ability to see everything you're doing and what URLs you visit.

In Firefox, the situation was worse: every extension had the power to access your private data, and you weren't informed.  In Chrome, at least, those extensions that need to run on every page show you a warning before you install them!

It comes down to *trust*: you should not install extensions that ask for more permission than you are comfortable with, unless you trust the author(s).  !AdBlock is the most popular extension for Chrome, partially because we care so much about our users -- so we hope you'll trust us :)

== How do I uninstall? ==

Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions -> !AdBlock Uninstall.

Safari: Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> !AdBlock Uninstall.

== My browser won't update to the latest version of !AdBlock! ==

Chrome: Yes it will, it might just take a few weeks.  !AdBlock is so popular that Google tells your browser not to update as frequently, to save Google bandwidth.  If you must have the newest version now, you'll have to uninstall, then reinstall from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom .  Make sure to copy any custom filters you've made under !AdBlock Options -> Customize so you can paste them back in.

Safari: You may have auto-update of extensions turned off.  Turn it on under Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> Updates.  You can also be sure to update to the latest version by reinstalling from safariadblock.com.  Be aware that !AdBlock For Safari is usually a few versions behind !AdBlock For Chrome.

== I see ads in a video! ==

!AdBlock can block ads in many !YouTube videos, but not in videos on other websites.  We're waiting on support from Chrome to be able to block ads in videos everywhere.

== Can !AdBlock be set to block ads only on a few sites? ==

Sure.  Add this filter to your custom filters:

{{{@@*$document,domain=~domain1.com|~domain2.com|~domain3.com}}}

where domain1.com etc. are the sites where you want to block ads.

== How do I hunt down a bad filter? ==

If you're helping us with a problem caused by a bad filter and we ask you to hunt down the bad filter, here's how to do it.

Important: whenever you change your filters, it doesn't take effect on a tab until you reload the tab.

STEP ONE: Make sure the bad filter isn't one of the Options -> Customize filters which you have added yourself.
  1. Delete all filters in the Options -> Customize textbox and click Save.
  1. If the problem is gone, put them back one at a time until you find the bad filter.  Otherwise, go to STEP TWO.

STEP TWO: Find the bad list.
  1. Unsubscribe from all filter lists under Options -> Filter Lists.
  1. Subscribe to each of your lists individually until you find the one that brings the problem back.
  1. Unsubscribe from all filter lists again.

STEP THREE: Copy the bad list's filters into your Customize textbox.
  1. Turn on Options -> General -> Advanced Mode.
  1. Click Options -> Filter Lists -> Show Links To The Filter Lists.
  1. Click the link next to the bad list to see its contents.
  1. Copy the entire contents of the bad list.
  1. Paste into the Options -> Customize textbox.
  1. Verify that the problem is back.

STEP FOUR: Delete filters until only the bad filter remains.
  1. Reload the tab with the problem.
  1. If the problem is still there, delete the first half of the contents of the Customize textbox and click Save, then go to step 1.
  1. If the problem is gone, you deleted the bad filter.  So undo your delete in the textbox using Control-Z (Apple-Z on a Mac) and delete the second half of the contents instead; then go to step 1.

After about 10 of those delete-check-repeat cycles you should have it narrowed down to the single bad filter causing you trouble.
