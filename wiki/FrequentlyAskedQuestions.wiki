== How do I blacklist something? ==

Right-click on a page once it has finished loading, select "Block an ad on this page..." and you'll get a blacklisting UI or simply right-click an ad on a page and select "Block this ad".  You can also add the browser action button via the Options page, and blacklist from there.

== How do I undo if I blacklisted something accidentally? ==

The blacklist UI creates entries in the blacklist table on the Options page.  You can add, replace, or remove entries there if you are feeling advanced.

== How do I stop !AdBlock from running on a page? ==

Right-click (or use the browser action button) on a page, select "Don't run on this domain..." and you'll have the option to exclude that domain.  The Options page gives you a list of all excluded domains.

== Does this actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

Yes, but some ads still slip through as this feature isn't fully supported by Chrome yet. Please star [http://crbug.com/35897 Chromium issue 35897] if you want Chrome to implement this.
Also we are not yet able to block ads that appear in other plugins, like Flash.

== Are you the same guys that made Adblock Plus for Firefox? ==

No, the main developer for ABP is Vladimir Palant and he lives in Germany.  The main dev for !AdBlock is Michael Gundlach and he lives in Georgia in the US.  Both extensions use the !EasyList filter list (as well as several others) and those are maintained by independent users.


== Can I import my filters from Adblock Plus for Firefox? ==

Yes, you can. Select the rules in ABP in FF, press Ctrl-C, go to !AdBlock options, Customize tab, click Edit, and paste them in that text box.

== Can I synchronize my settings and filters among multiple computers? ==

Not automatically.  We're waiting on Chrome to add support for that.  You can manually set your settings the same, of course, and copy-and-paste your custom filters (from the !AdBlock Options Customize tab) between computers.

== My settings aren't saved and/or I see a pop up every time I start Chrome ==

This can have these reasons: 
 # Your settings file is corrupt. Chrome is working on a fix for this
 # You have a hyperactive 'disk cleaner' program (a program that will automatically delete data saved by webpages when you close the browser). You have to allow the '!LocalStorage' from your browser, as our settings are saved in a !LocalStorage file.
 # Also make sure your browser has access to the folder where !LocalStorage files are stored

== Do you recommend to subscribe to all filter lists? ==

No, not at all. Every filter has to be tested on each resource load. The more filters you have, the longer this will take. So every filter list written in languages you can't even read will slow you down without matching anything. Further, the more filter lists you are subscribed to, the more likely a resource will be incorrectly blocked. You can off course report it to the maintainer of that list [ListAuthorContacts here], but if you don't have to report anything, it's always easier. Last but not least: by subscribing to all filters, you are wasting bandwidth of the filter list authors. As said before, you won't use the filters, but they are still downloaded every 21 days or less.

== Do you maintain all filter lists yourselves? ==

No, we only maintain the !AdBlock custom filters. All other lists are maintained by volunteers that are not connected to !AdBlock. (Except for the Dutch list, which is maintained by !FamLam). To contact a list maintainer you can use the links or email addresses in ListAuthorContacts for the default lists. For custom lists you often have to look in the list itself to see if there is a contact address.

== When I install, Chrome warns me that !AdBlock will have access to all my private data and browsing history! ==

It's true.  !AdBlock has the *ability* to access to your private data, but it doesn't actually access it.  In order to remove ads from every web page, !AdBlock needs the permission to run on every web page; and any extension that runs on every web page has the ability to see everything you're doing and what URLs you visit.

In Firefox, the situation was worse: every extension had the power to access your private data, and you weren't informed.  In Chrome, at least, those extensions that need to run on every page show you a warning before you install them!

It comes down to *trust*: you should not install extensions that ask for more permission than you are comfortable with, unless you trust the author(s).  !AdBlock is the most popular extension for Chrome, partially because we care so much about our users -- so we hope you'll trust us :)

== How do I uninstall? ==

Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions -> !AdBlock Uninstall.

Safari: Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> !AdBlock Uninstall.

== My browser won't update to the latest version of !AdBlock! ==

Chrome: Go to https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom and click 'Install' to force the update.

Safari: You may have auto-update of extensions turned off.  Turn it on at Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions.  You can also be sure to update to the latest version by reinstalling from safariadblock.com.  Be aware that !AdBlock For Safari is usually a few versions behind !AdBlock For Chrome.

== I see ads in a video! ==

!AdBlock can block ads in many !YouTube videos, but not in videos on other websites.  We're waiting on support from Chrome to be able to block ads in videos everywhere.

== Can !AdBlock be set to block ads only on a few sites? ==

Sure.  Add this filter to your custom filters:

{{{@@*$document,domain=~domain1.com|~domain2.com|~domain3.com}}}

where domain1.com etc. are the sites where you want to block ads.
