== How do I get to the Options page? ==

Wrench -> Extensions -> !AdBlock Options.  From there you can subscribe to filters, change your settings, and play with your blacklist and whitelist.

== How do I blacklist something? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-K on a page once it has finished loading, and you'll get a blacklisting UI.  You can also add the browser action button via the Options page, and blacklist from there.

== How do I undo if I blacklisted something accidentally? ==

The blacklist UI creates entries in the blacklist table on the Options page.  You can add, replace, or remove entries there if you are feeling advanced.

== How do I stop !AdBlock from running on a page? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-L (or use the browser action button) on a page and you'll have the option to exclude that domain.  The Options page gives you a list of all excluded domains.

== Does this actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

Yes, but some ads still slip through as this feature isn't fully supported by Chrome yet. Please star issue chromium:35897 if you want Chrome to implement this.
Also we are not yet able to block ads that appear in other plugins, like Flash.

== Isn't that slow? ==

Nope!  We do as much as we can to optimize the rules in your filter lists.  A simple example is that we jump through some hoops to convert as many regular-expression-based rules as we can to substring-matching rules, because that's much faster in Chrome.

== Are you the same guys that made !AdBlockPlus for Firefox? ==

No, the main developer for ABP is Vladimir Palant and he lives in Germany.  The main dev for !AdBlock is Michael Gundlach and he lives in Georgia in the US.  Both extensions use the !EasyList filter list (as well as several others) and those are maintained by independent users.

== Do you maintain all filter lists yourselves? ==

No, we only maintain the !AdBlock custom filters. All other lists are maintained by volunteers that are not connected to !AdBlock. (Except for the Dutch list, which is maintained by !FamLam). To contact a list maintainer you can use the links or email addresses in ListAuthorContacts for the default lists. For custom lists you often have to look in the list itself to see if there is a contact address.

== When I install, Chrome warns me that !AdBlock will have access to all my private data! ==

It's true.  !AdBlock has the *ability* to access to your private data, but it doesn't actually access it.  In order to remove ads from every web page, !AdBlock needs the permission to run on every web page; and any extension that runs on every web page has the ability to see everything you're doing.

In Firefox, the situation was worse: every extension had the power to access your private data, and you weren't informed.  In Chrome, at least, those extensions that need to run on every page show you a warning before you install them!

It comes down to *trust*: you should not install extensions that ask for more permission than you are comfortable with, unless you trust the author(s).  !AdBlock is (as of writing) the #2 most popular extension for Chrome, partially because we care so much about our users -- so we hope you'll trust us :)

== How can I help? ==

Oh man, lots of ways:

  * Report a bug via the Issues tab above.
  * Report an ad in the same place.
  * Update ad reports with the filters that would block the ad.
  * Verify that you can reproduce an existing bug.  Turn on debugging via !AdBlock Options, and see if anything interesting shows up in the Javascript Console.
  * Offer to translate (we're not there yet but we will be)
  * Rate us five stars on the installation page at http://bit.ly/ChromeAdBlock .
  * Tell your friends about us!
