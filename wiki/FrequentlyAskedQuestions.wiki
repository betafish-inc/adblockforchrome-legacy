== How do I get to the Options page? ==

Wrench -> Extensions -> !AdBlock Options.  From there you can subscribe to filters, change your settings, and play with your blacklist and whitelist.

== How do I blacklist something? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-K on a page once it has finished loading, and you'll get a blacklisting UI.  You can also add the browser action button via the Options page, and blacklist from there.

== How do I undo if I blacklisted something accidentally? ==

The blacklist UI creates entries in the blacklist table on the Options page.  You can add, replace, or remove entries there if you are feeling advanced.

== How do I stop !AdBlock from running on a page? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-L (or use the browser action button) on a page and you'll have the option to whitelist that domain.  The Options page gives you a list of whitelisted domains.

== Does this actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

No.  We're waiting on a feature for Chrome by a guy named Pavel that will allow that, but for now it uses a combination of CSS rules and jQuery.

== Isn't that slow? ==

Nope!  We do as much as we can to optimize the rules in your filter lists.  A simple example is that we jump through some hoops to convert as many regular-expression-based rules as we can to substring-matching rules, because that's much faster in Chrome.

== When I install, Chrome warns me that !AdBlock will have access to all my private data! ==

It's true.  !AdBlock has the *ability* to access to your private data, but it doesn't actually access it.  In order to remove ads from every web page, !AdBlock needs the permission to run on every web page; and any extension that runs on every web page has the ability to see everything you're doing.

In Firefox, the situation was worse: every extension had the power to access your private data, and you weren't informed.  In Chrome, at least, those extensions that need to run on every page show you a warning before you install them!

It comes down to *trust*: you should not install extensions that ask for more permission than you are comfortable with, unless you trust the author(s).  !AdBlock is (as of writing) the #2 most popular extension for Chrome, partially because we care so much about our users -- so we hope you'll trust us :)

== Are you the same guys that made !AdBlockPlus for Firefox? ==

No, the main developer for ABP is Vladimir Palant and he lives in Germany.  The main dev for !AdBlock is Michael Gundlach and he lives in Georgia in the US.  Both extensions use the !EasyList filter list (as well as several others) and those are maintained by independent users.

== How can I help? ==

Oh man, lots of ways:

  * Report a bug via the Issues tab above.
  * Report an ad in the same place.
  * Update ad reports with the filters that would block the ad.
  * Verify that you can reproduce an existing bug.  Turn on debugging via !AdBlock Options, and see if anything interesting shows up in the Javascript Console.
  * Offer to translate (we're not there yet but we will be)
  * Rate us five stars on the installation page at http://bit.ly/ChromeAdBlock .
  * Tell your friends about us!

Thanks for asking! :)
