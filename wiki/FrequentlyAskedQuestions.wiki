= About the project =

== Who made !AdBlock? ==

I'm Michael Gundlach, a developer in Georgia in the US.  Hi!  I created !AdBlock in 2009.  In 2010 I quit my job to work solely on !AdBlock, so my wife and I rely on [https://chromeadblock.com/pay/ your support] for our income.

In addition to financial support, anyone can [HowToContribute contribute code or time] to the project.  About a dozen [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/people/list contributors] have [Changelog done so] over the years.

== How does !AdBlock work? Do I have to configure it? ==

!AdBlock automatically blocks all ads on web pages for you, with no configuration necessary.  As soon as you install it, you can open a tab to nytimes.com (for example), and there will be no ads on the page.

!AdBlock works by reading lists of all known ads on the internet.  Anything listed is blocked from loading in your browser.  !AdBlock doesn't control what goes on the lists; they are [ListAuthorContacts maintained by volunteers].

== Is !AdBlock available on the iPhone/iPad/Android? ==

Nope.  It's only available on [https://chromeadblock.com Chrome] and [https://safariadblock.com Safari].

== Is !AdBlock available on Firefox or Internet Explorer? ==

Nope.  It's only available on [https://chromeadblock.com Chrome] and [https://safariadblock.com Safari].  There's an unrelated project for Firefox called [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/ Adblock Plus] that works great.  If you're on IE, I recommend switching to Chrome :)

= Using !AdBlock =

== !AdBlock disappeared / isn't working right! ==

Sorry to hear that!  We can [http://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/GetHelp?tm=3 walk you through] fixing or reporting your problem.

== How do I block an ad? ==

Ads are blocked for you automatically, but if something slipped by !AdBlock, you can block it for yourself.  Just click the !AdBlock toolbar button and choose "Block an ad on this page", or simply right-click the ad itself and choose "Block this ad".

== I blocked too much!  How do I undo it? ==

Blocking an ad adds a new "filter" to the list on the the Customize tab on the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options page.  You can click Edit on that list, remove the filter, and click Save.

== How do I tell !AdBlock not to run? ==

You can pause !AdBlock, or tell it to never run on certain websites, under the !AdBlock toolbar button menu.

== I see an ad!  How do I report it? == 

You can block an ad for yourself if you'd like (see above); or you can report it so that it will be blocked for everyone.

Don't report ads in the Issue tracker.  Instead, do the following:

   # Click the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options -> General -> "Show me advanced options"
   # Click the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Report an ad

You'll get the fix automatically a few days after your report is processed.

== How do I report that !AdBlock is blocking a non-ad? ==

!AdBlock reads lists of filters to know what to block.  It may be that one of those lists has a bad filter.  In that case, don't report it in the Issue tracker: !AdBlock doesn't maintain the lists.  Instead, follow [#How_do_I_hunt_down_a_bad_filter? these instructions] to find the bad filter, then report it to the [ListAuthorContacts correct filter list maintainer].

== How do I uninstall !AdBlock? ==

Chrome: Right click the !AdBlock toolbar button and choose "Remove from Chrome".

Safari: Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> !AdBlock Uninstall.

<hr>

= Common problems =

== !AdBlock doesn't work in Incognito mode. ==

In Chrome, extensions are disabled by default in Incognito mode. You can enable it in chrome://extensions by checking 'Allow in incognito'.

== My browser won't update to the latest version of !AdBlock. ==

Chrome: because !AdBlock is so popular, updates take a few weeks to roll out.  You can [https://chromeadblock.com/help/outofdate force it to update] if you're impatient.

Safari: You may have auto-update of extensions turned off.  Turn it on under Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions -> Updates.  You can also be sure to update to the latest version by reinstalling from safariadblock.com.

== I see ads in a video in Safari. ==

See [GetHelp here].

== When I install, Chrome warns me that !AdBlock will have access to "Your data on all websites" and "Your tabs and browsing activity"! ==

!AdBlock has the *ability* to access this data, but it doesn't actually access it.  !AdBlock needs this permission in order to run on every page, so that it can block ads for you; that's all.  Nothing sneaky is going on.

It comes down to *trust*: you should not install extensions that ask for more permission than you are comfortable with, unless you trust the author(s).  !AdBlock is the most popular extension for Chrome, partially because we care so much about our users -- so we hope you'll trust us :)

= Advanced =

== Does !AdBlock actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

Yes!  Ad scripts, images, and Flash are not sent to your computer, saving you bandwidth.

== Can I synchronize my settings and filters among multiple computers? ==

Not automatically.  You can manually set your settings the same, of course, and copy-and-paste your custom filters (from the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options -> Customize tab) between computers.

== Can I import my filters from Adblock Plus for Firefox? ==

Yes, you can, by copying them to the clipboard, then pasting them into the list on the !AdBlock toolbar button -> Options -> Customize tab.

== How do I hunt down a bad filter? ==

If you're helping us with a problem caused by a bad filter and we ask you to hunt down the bad filter, here's how to do it.

Important: whenever you change your filters, it doesn't take effect on a tab until you reload the tab.

STEP ONE: Make sure the bad filter isn't one of the Options -> Customize filters which you have added yourself.
  1. Delete all filters in the Options -> Customize textbox and click Save.
  1. If the problem is gone, put them back one at a time until you find the bad filter.  Otherwise, go to STEP TWO.

STEP TWO: Find the bad list.
  1. Unsubscribe from all filter lists under Options -> Filter Lists.
  1. Subscribe to each of your lists individually until you find the one that brings the problem back.
  1. Unsubscribe from all filter lists again.

STEP THREE: Copy the bad list's filters into your Customize textbox.
  1. Turn on Options -> General -> Advanced Mode.
  1. Click Options -> Filter Lists -> Show Links To The Filter Lists.
  1. Click the link next to the bad list to see its contents.
  1. Copy the entire contents of the bad list.
  1. Paste into the Options -> Customize textbox.
  1. Verify that the problem is back.

STEP FOUR: Delete filters until only the bad filter remains.
  1. Reload the tab with the problem.
  1. If the problem is still there, delete the first half of the contents of the Customize textbox and click Save, then go to step 1.
  1. If the problem is gone, you deleted the bad filter.  So undo your delete in the textbox using Control-Z (Apple-Z on a Mac) and delete the second half of the contents instead; then go to step 1.

After about 10 of those delete-check-repeat cycles you should have it narrowed down to the single bad filter causing you trouble.

== What filter lists should I use? ==

If you speak multiple languages, you may wish to use filter lists for those languages.  Otherwise, just use the defaults that !AdBlock chooses.  Using unnecessary lists slows down !AdBlock and wastes bandwidth for the list maintainers.
