#summary The FAQ.

== How do I get to the Options page? ==

Wrench -> Extensions -> AdBlock Options.  From there you can subscribe to filters, change your settings, and play with your blacklist and whitelist.

== How do I blacklist something? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-K on a page once it has finished loading, and you'll get a blacklisting UI.  You can also add the browser action button via the Options page, and blacklist from there.

== How do I undo if I blacklisted something accidentally? ==

The blacklist UI creates entries in the blacklist table on the Options page.  You can add, replace, or remove entries there if you are feeling advanced.

== How do I stop AdBlock from running on a page? ==

Press Ctrl-Shift-L (or use the browser action button) on a page and you'll have the option to whitelist that domain.  The Options page gives you a list of whitelisted domains.

== Does this actually prevent ads from downloading? ==

No.  We're waiting on a feature for Chrome by a guy named Pavel that will allow that, but for now it uses a combination of CSS rules and jQuery.

== Isn't that slow? ==

Nope!  We do as much as we can to optimize the rules in your filter lists.  A simple example is that we jump through some hoops to convert as many regular-expression-based rules as we can to substring-matching rules, because that's much faster in Chrome.
